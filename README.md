## Feature Tasks

Feature Tasks are broken down into the following sub sections.

### Homepage

- [X] Create a Homepage.
- [X] The main page should be built out to match the wireframe.
- [X] Should have a heading at the top of the page, an image to mock the “my tasks” view.
- [X] Should have buttons at the bottom of the page.
- [X] Should allow going to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.
- [X] Create a Task Detail page. It should have a title at the top of the page, and a Lorem Ipsum description.
- [X] Create a Settings page. It should allow users to enter their username and hit save.
- [X] The main page should be modified to contain three different buttons with hardcoded task titles. When a user taps one of the titles, it should go to the Task Detail page, and the title at the top of the page should match the task title that was tapped on the previous page.
- [X] The homepage should also contain a button to visit the Settings page, and once the user has entered their username, it should display “{username}’s tasks” above the three task buttons.
- [X] Refactor home page to use a RecyclerView for displaying Task data. Will be hard-coded data for now.
- [X] Implement a Task Class with "States" for the tasks i.e.: "New", "Assigned", "In Progress", or "Complete".
- [X] Implement a ViewAdapter class to display data from list of Tasks
- [X] Create at least 3 hard-coded tasks in ~~MainActivity~~ HomeActivity.
- [X] A tapped task in RecyclerView will launch the ~~DetailPage~~ TaskDetailActivity with the correct Task Title displayed.
- [X] Refactor RecyclerView to display all Task Entities in the Database.

### Add a Task

- [X] The “Add a Task” page allows users to type in details about a new task.
- [X] Must show a title and a body.
- [X] When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.
- [X] Modify Add Task Form to save data entered as a Task in the local database.

### All Tasks

- [X] The 'all tasks' page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality.

### Details Tasks

- [X] Ensure the description and status of a tapped task are also displayed on the detail page.
- [X] Ensure the Title is still displayed.
- [X] ~~Decide whether to pass the entire Entity or to~~ only pass ~~an ID~~ using an Intent.

### Implementing Room For Data Management

- [X] Set up Room in the App and modify the Task Class to be an Entity.

### Styling and Stretch Goals

Stretch goals:

- [X] Decide on a color scheme.
- [X] Decide font families. For now will stick with the built-in Android font-families.
- [ ] Allow the user to specify on their settings page how many tasks should be shown on the homepage. Use this to dynamically create buttons for as many tasks as the user requests.
- [X] Also display the description of the task rather than Lorem Ipsum text.
